    <h1>For the West and Palestine</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>For the West and Palestine</strong> is an advocacy initiative committed to holding Western institutions accountable for their support of policies that contribute to the oppression of Palestinians. We believe in the value and necessity of institutions like the EU and NATO, but we challenge their complicity in upholding Zionist policies that violate international law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our aim is not to dismantle these organizations, but to critique them where they have done wrong.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="eu_association_agreement.html">End the EU-Israel Association Agreement</a></li>
      <li><a href="eu_research_funding.html">Stop EU Research Funding to Israel</a></li>
      <li><a href="nato_cooperation.html">End NATO-Israel Military Cooperation</a></li>
      <li><a href="eu_bds_policy.html">Respect the Right to Boycott</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, we can shape a West that supports it's own institutions like the European Union and NATO while critiquing their support for Zionism, and policies that unnecessarily reinforce hostility to them.

    <h1>End the EU-Israel Association Agreement</h1>
    <p>
      The EU-Israel Association Agreement, signed in 1995 and in force since 2000, establishes strong economic, political, and social ties between the European Union and Israel. While framed as a partnership, the agreement grants Israel preferential trade access to the EU’s single market—its most valuable trading partner.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Provisions of the Agreement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Preferential Trade:</strong> Israeli goods receive tariff-free or reduced-tariff access to EU markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Dialogue:</strong> Allows high-level engagement on foreign policy, regional security, and diplomatic cooperation.</li>
      <li><strong>Scientific & Cultural Cooperation:</strong> Facilitates Israeli participation in EU programs such as Horizon Europe.</li>
      <li><strong>Joint Committees:</strong> Manage the implementation of the agreement, including trade disputes and economic coordination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Must Be Suspended</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Violation of International Law:</strong> Israel continues expanding illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, in direct breach of international norms and multiple UN resolutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Human Rights Clause Ignored:</strong> The agreement includes a clause making human rights a condition for cooperation. Israel’s actions violate this, yet the agreement remains in place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic Support of Occupation:</strong> Trade with Israel often includes goods and services originating from settlements built on occupied land.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Settlement Products Labeled but Not Banned:</strong> Despite a 2015 European Court of Justice ruling requiring labeling of settlement goods, these products can still enter the EU market under the agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tariff Benefits:</strong> Israeli exports to the EU surpassed €16 billion in 2023, much of it under preferential terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scientific Collaboration:</strong> Israeli institutions, some of which are linked to the military and surveillance industry, benefit from EU-funded programs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Demands</h2>
    <p>
      We call on the European Union to immediately suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement until Israel fully complies with international law, including an end to settlement expansion and human rights abuses in the occupied territories.
    </p>
    <p>
      EU law must not be selectively enforced. Human rights should be the foundation of all partnerships—not an optional clause.
